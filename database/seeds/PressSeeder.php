                'description' => "Several years ago, when Alexander Shing was just about to graduate from MIT, he worked for a tech company located at 283 Summer St.\n\n“At that time, everyone in my company would just park in the Seaport,” he said with a laugh. “I went to the Seaport because it was cheap parking, and a short distance from Summer Street. But that’s changed.”\n\nIt changed this fall to the tune of $120 million— the amount Shing’s Cottonwood Management paid for the final two master-planned parcels in Seaport Square. Shing recruited Rebecca Mattson, long a fixture in Boston’s real estate development community, to be a principal on the $800 million, 1 million-square-foot project.\n\nI caught up with Shing and Mattson this week to talk about Cottonwood’s plans for Seaport Square, setting up a permanent office in Boston and why paying $120 million for two flat parking lots was actually a pretty good deal.\n\nHow did you first come to know Boston and the Seaport?\n\nShing: I worked for a technology software firm right out of college at MIT — I actually hadn’t finished college yet, I had one foot still in. But at that time, everyone in my company would just park in the Seaport. I lived in Boston for nearly 10 years, so I’m very familiar with the city.\n\nMattson: I’ve been in Boston for 25 years. I’ve done a lot of large-scale real estate development in downtown, like the original Boston Garden, and I also worked for Raymond Property Co.\n\nAlex, you founded Cottonwood in 2011 near Los Angeles. Why California?\n\nShing: We had our first project in Orange County, so it was kind of a logical place to be. But we always wanted to return. I was looking for a reason to return, and a lot of my team members are from Boston, and so we wanted to be back in Boston.\n\nWhat sparked your respective interest in real estate?\n\nShing: I went into private equity after tech, and in private equity a lot of the underlying assets that you’re investing in is real estate. I found myself dealing with real estate all over the world. Sometimes it wasn’t real estate in the conventional sense — it could be a single-use facility. But there was always a real estate thesis.\n\nWhat drew your interest to the Seaport?\n\nShing: We’ve been looking at the Seaport since 2012. Parcels B and C were one of the early ones to move. Skanska got a few moving, then Vertex came in. There’s no developable master plan of that magnitude in the city anymore. We consider that the heart of the city. You cross over a bridge and you’re at the center of everything. And given our roots in Boston, we really believe it’s up and coming.\n\nUsing financing from Celona Capital of Hong Kong, HGC Capital Group of Beijing and Boston Private Bank & Trust, Cottonwood paid almost $120 million for what’s essentially a 3.5-acre parking lot. Was that hard to stomach?\n\nShing: It took me time to get comfortable and wrap my head around it. I think we got it on a good cost basis, believe it or not. You have to believe in the macroeconomics. It’s very locale-driven. National employment trends are good. But Boston as a city, its future and the keyhold to innovation makes it the magnet to bring a lot of young professionals to establish roots. I have so many of my friends that have worked in other places, including Silicon Valley, and come back here to settle down. I hope we’re right.\n\nWhat else signals to you that it was a good deal?\n\nShing: I always tell people not from Boston, ‘which city in the U.S. can support two Four Seasons?’ New York is one. Boston’s the other. And with GE deciding to move its headquarters here gives a little tailwind. I have to think that they’re banking on the same thesis that we have in mind: talent, young people, innovation, technology. And to attract good talent, you need people willing to build their roots here. Obviously they want people who grow and work with GE, and I think they’re betting that people would put their roots in Boston.\n\n Mattson: And put the cost into perspective. We’re building over a million square feet. Where can you have 1 million square feet of above ground development with a below-grade parking garage? It puts into perspective. We paid $120 million, and WS Development paid $359 million — but they’re also building millions of square feet. It’s just on a different level.\n\nHow did things change from the originally approved master plan for parcels M1 and M2?\n\nMattson: We changed it from two large blocks of development into three, with a pedestrian courtyard. With that stepdown in size, we made it have this fabric that’s totally different than anything the Seaport has seen.\n\nIs there a fear that, after a three-year buildout, that you’ll have missed the real-estate cycle? That there won’t be demand for luxury living in the Seaport at the rate we’re seeing today?\n\nShing: That’s why I started with the macroeconomics. It’s always driven by population, what’s there, job employment opportunities in the city. We think it’s going to be tremendous, especially in this area. GE has said it wants the Seaport. And people want to live where near they work. We think all of those are positive trends. Second of all, we definitely are looking to build a unique, high-quality product. A lot of it will be driven by the product itself. We’re hoping that the design, the consideration with which we’re really trying to build a community, and help grow this neighborhood, will be positive factors. I think, in three years, this will be a more tremendous neighborhood to live in than it is now.\n\nIs that why you decided to go for condominiums, rather than multifamily rentals?\n\nShing: Right now there are a lot of rentals. And I think the district could really use homeownership, owners looking to really live there with a family, rather than transience. Renters are good too, but it’s just a different demographic.\n\nIs Cottonwood looking to do other projects in Boston?\n\nShing: Our goal is to do more projects in Boston. We’ve set up an office at 225 Franklin St., and we are adding more folks in Boston. We’re expecting three or four people to be permanently based out here. We’re just having conversations right now. We want to work with all the stakeholders — the neighborhood, City Hall, the BRA — to really deliver a spectacular, world-class project.",

                'description' => "Cottonwood Management’s groundbreaking ceremony on its new $900 million, three-tower Seaport District development was more than just the latest mega-project to hit Boston via a new development player in town.\n\nThe project also marks an escalation in Boston’s luxury living wars, with a new building operator entering the local concierge-lifestyle market: Regent Hotel Group, which will provide and oversee the numerous services offered to pampered residents at Cottonwood’s future Echelon Seaport, as its new Seaport development has been dubbed.\n\nLos Angeles-based Cottonwood, making its first development foray into Boston, clearly wants to make a splash in what its CEO, Alex Shing, calls the “hottest” residential luxury market in the United States.\n\n“It’s become a destination point,” said Shing of the Seaport in particular and Boston, in general. “Boston has become ever more international and globally known. We have a lot of confidence in this area.”\n\nPart of the Echelon Seaport’s appeal will be its design aesthetics and 50,0000 square feet of physical amenities, such as two outdoor pools, courtyards, sky lounges, indoor spa, fitness center and other perks for those living in the 733 luxury condominiums, apartments and innovation units. The 1.3 million-square-foot project will also boast 125,000 square feet of upscale retail and restaurants.\n\nBut Shing’s secret weapon may be his partnership with Regent Hotel Group, usually associated with high-end hotels and residential buildings in Hong Kong, Singapore and other parts of Asia.\n\n“It will exceed and go way beyond expectations,” Shing said of the services Regent plans to offer residents at Echelon Seaport, after it opens in about 36 months.\n\nRegent Hotel Group could not be reached for comment and Cottonwood was mum about what “innovative” services it will offer at Echelon Seaport. Additional details, however, are expected to be released this fall.\n\nSue Hawkes, managing director at Boston-based Collaborative Cos. – a high-end real estate company that will help market units at Echelon Seaport – said no one should underestimate Regent’s potential to surprise people with the level of services it may end up providing. The services will probably go well beyond the standard 24/7 concierge services now demanded and provided at most high-end residential towers in Boston, she said.\n\nToday, concierge services are more along the lines of “lifestyle” assistance, such as setting up dog walkers for residents or arranging child care for tenants, she said. The services also include arranging catered dinners and parties, guest speakers in lounges and other events, said Hawkes, who also works with the developers of Ink Block, Pierce Boston and Slip 65 at Clippership Wharf.\n\nA ‘White-Glove Experience’\n\nAmong the other concierge/luxury-service providers now working in Boston, or which are planning to work in Boston, are Luxury Attaché, First Service Residential and Four Seasons. Some developers, such as Millennium Partners, prefer to provide their own branded in-house concierge and lifestyle services.\n\n“It’s gotten so competitive,” said Hawkes of the different corporate entities now operating and providing services to luxury residents in Boston.\n\nJenene Ronick, founder and CEO of New York-based Luxury Attaché, agrees that Boston’s luxury market has blossomed in recent years – and become highly competitive. Developers tout their hiring of “concierge and lifestyle” providers as a marketing tool to sell condos and rent apartments, she said.\n\nLuxury Attaché, which operates in Washington D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco as well as New York, is currently on site at Samuels & Assoc.’s Pierce Boston tower and Related Beal’s 157-unit Lovejoy Wharf development in Boston and will be offering luxury services to residents once those two projects open.\n\nRonick said there may be smaller “mom and pop” concierge-service companies out there, but it takes a “deep infrastructure” to provide the level of services that high-end tenants want. Such companies need call centers, sophisticated software to track the requests of residents, and experienced staff who have the contacts to make things happen for residents, from getting tickets to a hot theater performance to finding top chefs to cater dinners, she said.\n\nRonick said Luxury Attaché hopes to expand to other residential buildings in Boston – and maybe into office buildings, where high-end corporate tenants are now demanding more services from building owners.\n\nAt the Pier 4 development in Boston’s Seaport District, Tishman Speyer has hired FirstService Residential, also making its Boston luxury-market premier, to be its future provider of concierge services, once its 9-story, 106-unit project is finished.\n\nIt’s the initial Boston foray for First Service Residential, which has a significant presence in Florida’s luxury condo scene. Service components will include catering, doormen, a concierge and a “rover” attendant to coordinate events such as private parties in the building’s Topsider Lounge.\n\n“They’ve raised the bar to truly create a white-glove experience,” said Janice Dumont, CEO of sales agent Advisors Living, a division of Boston Realty Advisors.\n\nCottonwood’s Shing expressed confidence his firm’s new Echelon Seaport will shine once it opens, staff competition or not, thanks partly to the partnership with Regent.\n\n“Their name is synonymous with luxury,” he said.",

The 1.3 million square foot property will accompany projects such as OMA’s 88 Seaport and developments by James Corner Field Operations, Sasaki, and NADAAA.\n\nDue to its accessibility to the Boston Harbor, the area has historically been known as a space for industrial and commercial use. Factors such as proximity to Boston’s downtown have spurred developments such as the Echelon Seaport that aim to introduce residential living into the fabric of the neighborhood. Developed by Cottonwood Management, the project will feature 733 residential condominiums along with 125,000 square feet of publicly accessible restaurants and retail.\n\nThe development is broken into three towers of differing heights in order to create visual interest. To further that design initiative, the facade of the building is a mixture of glass and masonry. According to the architects, the focus on a diversified aesthetic is a nod to the collection of styles and materials that make up Boston’s current skyline.\n\n“Our design for the project transforms a larger site into a series of three, smaller-scaled towers, where each is given a subtly differentiated architectural character, said James von Klemperer, KPF President and Design Principal.”\n\nIntegral to the design is the something currently lacking in the neighborhood-- public space. Looking towards the future of Seaport, the architects identified the need for a dynamic urban streetscape that encourages civic interaction. The point where the three towers meet forms a central courtyard that features multi-level retail space connected through passageways and a bridge.\n\nRenderings of the project show both the large-scale connections between towers and the smaller layered connections of the retail and public spaces. The renderings also detail the additional exterior space in the building such as sun decks, terraces, and pools that are designated for the private residences.\n\n“The buildings enliven the adjacent streets with active retail, finely crafted details, and smaller scale visual moments of surprise said Klemperer.”\n\nPre-construction for Echelon Seaport began in March 2017 and is on track for final completion in 2020.",

Our world-class team is delivering an intelligent approach to an engaged urban lifestyle with the highest standards of quality and design.\n\nEchelon Seaport is the first installment of Cottonwood’s Echelon innovation and luxury lifestyle brand, which will soon include a New York City Echelon-concepted project, located steps from the Empire State building on Fifth Avenue.\n\nDuring their remarks at the groundbreaking, both Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh noted the Seaport’s rise to global prominence, as it continues to attract international brands and investment.\n\nThis project is a welcome addition to Massachusetts’ global community and the City of Boston’s thriving seaport district,” said Governor Baker. “As state and local officials work collaboratively with Cottonwood Management on developing this site over the next several months, we look forward to the positive impact it will have on the community.”\n\n“This project paves the way for more people to see the Seaport as a place to not only work in and visit—but also a place to live in and call home,” said Mayor Walsh. “I look forward to the Seaport continuing to become an innovative, welcoming neighborhood for all.”\n\nThe groundbreaking ceremony was followed by an upscale celebratory unveiling of the Echelon vision and brand, complete with an Echelon inspired cocktail and demonstration by Chef Ming Tsai, a James Beard award-winning chef and owner of nearby Blue Dragon restaurant.\n\nIt’s amazing what the Seaport has done in the past four years Blue Dragon has been open”, said Ming Tsai. “We are excited to welcome Cottonwood’s Echelon Seaport as both a neighbor and as part of the development of our neighborhood into an international destination.”\n\nBoasting 887,000 square feet of 733 luxury residential condominiums and apartments, Echelon Seaport will feature two signature outdoor pools, an indoor pool, expansive sun decks, engaging courtyards, and oversized private terraces. Answering the call for new distinctive public spaces to shape the path of the future of Seaport, Echelon Seaport’s three towers will meet in the middle at a destination piazza, featuring an architecturally striking landmark bridge, outdoor seating on multiple levels, distinctive artwork, beautiful tree canopies, and more than 125,000 square feet of luxury restaurants and retail lining the multiple passageways and streets leading to the central courtyard.\n\nResidents of the Echelon lifestyle can expect the finest and the most diverse set of residential amenities, which will be announced over coming months as the lifestyle condominium sales center prepares for a Fall 2017 opening. The condominiums will be branded by the iconic Regent Hotel Group, establishing a premium white-glove level of service for all residents, by a benchmark of five-star luxury hotel service and quality known around the world.\n\n“We have always enjoyed a strong brand presence in the US market as a result of our original properties in New York City, Boston, Chicago, and Beverly Hills,” said Steven Pan, Chairman of Regent Hotels Group. “We have long intended to return to Regent cities in the US, and are happy to find the right partnership with Cottonwood Management.”\n\nDesigned by internationally-renowned Kohn Pedersen Fox and Boston-based CBT Architects, the 3.5-acre development at Seaport Boulevard and B Street has been designed with diverse heights and building materials to reflect Boston’s eclectic skyline and to create a neighborhood-oriented, active, urban streetscape.\n\n“Our design for the project transforms a larger site into a series of three, smaller-scaled towers, where each is given a subtly differentiated architectural character,” said James von Klemperer, KPF President and Design Principal. “The buildings enliven the adjacent streets with active retail, finely crafted details, and smaller scale visual moments of surprise. The central courtyard features several tiers of active programming, resulting in a memorable ‘urban village’ space, KPF is proud to be a contributor alongside Cottonwood Management and CBT Architects, to the latest addition to the City of Boston.”\n\nThe building’s exterior mixes glass with masonry to reflect the contemporary vision of the master plans as well the character of the neighboring Fort Point Channel. The design is rich in texture and detail, reflecting KPF’s expertise in creating new landmarks and innovative, memorable mixed-use developments around the world.\n\n“Echelon Seaport’s design honors the Seaport’s rich history and expansive future,” said Phil Casey, Principal at CBT. “In collaboration with KPF Associates, we are honored to help create Cottonwood Management’s vision for community by incorporating the Seaport’s distinct culture and Harbor surroundings throughout residents’ daily experience of space.”\n\nThe project began pre-construction in March 2017, concurrent with the opening of Cottonwood’s new East Coast headquarters office, located in Boston at 101 Seaport Boulevard, the award-winning new PricewaterhouseCoopers building. 101 Seaport will also be the address of Echelon’s upcoming residential lifestyle condominium sales center, which will be led by The Collaborative Companies later this fall.\n\nHeadquartered in Los Angeles with offices in Boston and New York, Cottonwood Management is a privately-held real estate asset management and development company with over $2 billion in assets under management.

Beers will be focusing on every detail of the vaulted-ceiling lobbies and lounge areas; two tailored outdoor pool terraces, fitness facilities including an indoor basketball court, indoor relaxation pool, golf simulator, wine room, library, children’s playroom and even a sky lounge in each tower, to imbue exceptional character and feel across the entire residential address.\n\n“A true artist and global citizen, Jeffrey Beers’ international influence and experience embodies the luxurious aesthetic of the Echelon lifestyle brand,” said Cottonwood chairman and CEO, Alex Shing. “Threading together art and intellect, simplicity and culture, EchelonSeaport will attract residents that desire a residence exuding sophistication, community and authenticity.”\n\nReflecting on what sets EchelonSeaport lifestyle apart from the current residential real estate market, Beers said, “In a single word: community. We have a wealth of amenities, especially outdoor spaces, which blend into indoor spaces, each servicing diverse functions and appealing to different tastes. They share a common goal: Echelon’s amenities are an extension of the home, they are about expanding the definition of your residence, bringing people together and creating connectivity.”\n\nThe 133 & 135 Seaport towers will each have a uniquely detailed feel and will be connected by the landmark EchelonSeaport pedestrian bridge. The first tower, 133 Seaport, located along Seaport Blvd., will have private outdoor terraces, a waterfall pool, boutique spa and entertaining areas. The second tower, 135 Seaport, headed at Seaport Blvd. and extending along B St., will have fitness components and collaborative spaces, while still impeccably tailored in design and function.\n\nJeffrey Beers International, has received many prestigious awards for its high-caliber design portfolio across the United States, Asia, Latin America and Europe. Ranging from hospitality to residential, JBI’s award-winning interior designs include the landmark Fontainebleau Resort in Miami, the historic lobby and amenity spaces of One Hundred Barclay in New York City and Dune by Jean-Georges Vongerichten in The Bahamas.\n\nJBI joins an esteemed architectural team. Internationally-renowned firm Kohn Pedersen Fox collaborated with Boston-based CBT to design EchelonSeaport’s distinctive exterior. Complementing Beers’ vision to honor Boston’s classic American style on the interior, EchelonSeaport’s facade features diverse heights, materials and elements to reflect Boston’s eclectic skyline and the city’s timelessness.\n\nAnother noteworthy name was added to the team in 2016 when Cottonwood announced EchelonSeaport would partner with Regent Hotels & Resorts, to bring its five-star level of service to the condominiums, which will carry the esteemed designation as a Regent Collection property. This collaboration of Beers’ and Regent Hotels & Resorts combines luxury detailing and design.\n\nJBI will also design the interior lobby and amenities for a third tower, currently slated for 285 apartments, opening early 2020. The design will be influenced by the history of neighboring Fort Point and feature an artisanal industrial style to blend residential luxury with a decidedly urban, textured feel.\n\nA preview of the 133 & 135 Seaport condominium design elements will open to prospective residents at the EchelonSeaport sales center in early 2018. The sales center, designed by JBI and Williams New York, will feature interactive models, neighborhood narratives, finishes and fixtures, as well as a model unit furnished by JBI.\n\nHeadquartered in Los Angeles with offices in Boston and New York, Cottonwood Management is a privately-held real estate asset management and development company with over $2 billion in assets under management.

                'description' => "To go up 232 feet in a tower crane, first you have to go down.\n\nThere are three wooden stairwells at opposing points of EchelonSeaport’s perimeter at 145 Seaport Blvd. that lead down at least 30 feet into a concrete foundation. Descending into the chasm, the sounds of traffic rushing toward I-90 diminishes, replaced by whirring equipment, sharp metallic pings and the crunch of wet gravel beneath steel-toed boots. The cavernous chasm will eventually be a below-grade parking garage.\n\nEchelonSeaport, the vision of Cottonwood Management, is the latest development in the prodigiously busy Seaport District. It will eventually span 1.33 million square feet across three towers, with 447 luxury condominiums and more than 200 apartments, some 50,000 square feet of outdoor and indoor amenity space designed by renowned design studio Jeffrey Beers International and another 125,000 square feet of retail space, all surrounding a central public piazza.\n\nJohn Moriarty & Associates of Winchester is building EchelonSeaport, and it’s JMA’s Safety & Health Supervisor Kai Wilson who leads me and a photographer down Stairwell A to the wet concrete and gravel floor on a recent cloudy weekday afternoon. EchelonSeaport will eventually have five tower cranes up at the site.\n\nAt present, two dull-red cranes tower above. Wilson leads us to Mike Sheehan, the on-the-ground “tag man,” who is responsible for keeping the crane’s rigging safe and does a visual check every time a crane lifts something into the air.\n\nThe tower we’re ascending is a “luffing jib” tower, manufactured by Potain, a brand of crane maker Manitowac Co. It stands at 232 feet, with a 26-ton hook that can handle loads of up to 52,000 pounds.\n\nBut the hook is at the very top, and the only way to get an up-close look is to climb a series of ladders — and keep climbing. Sheehan cautions to stay in the center of the ladder, and to use your quadriceps — the body’s biggest muscle — while climbing, to avoid wearing out your arms. For Sheehan, climbing up a tower crane is old news. He was born and bred into this work, and his father is a 73-year-old apprentice teacher who’s still in the classroom a few days a week. Sheehan recalls walking out on open steel at 10 years old.\n\nAny advice for those who may not be the best with heights? Sheehan smiles. “Everybody can overcome it,” he says. Sure, there are days where climbing will send your gut swooping. Even though the tower is embedded into a concrete foundation, locked into a stand secured eight feet into the ground, it has the capacity to sway up to four feet in any direction. But just keep moving up, he says, and it’ll pass. Contrary to the popular “don’t look down” belief, Sheehan advises folks to pay attention to their surroundings, including looking down — once they’re safely located on a platform between ladders, of course.\n\nCrane Climb\n\nThe only way to get an up-close look of the top of a tower crane is to climb a series of ladders — and keep climbing. Here's a first-hand look from the top of a 232-foot “luffing jib” crane in Boston's Seaport District.\n\nEach metal ladder has 20 rungs, located about a foot apart, located between landing platforms. It’s an unusual sensation to traverse space that would typically only be open to those in Seaport offices, or on the planes taking off from nearby Boston Logan International Airport. The wind hits when you reach 180 feet, but luckily it’s not too blustery a day. The tower, mercifully, does not sway the anticipated four feet.\n\nPerhaps the most difficult maneuver is shimmying out from beneath the turntable, a piece of equipment that weighs a whopping 29,000 pounds, on which the bed of the crane sits. From behind hangs the counterweight, large blocks of steel that are used to balance both the weight of the crane itself as well as the weight of whatever is picked up. Moving from the somewhat cramped base beneath the turntable, up another metal ladder and onto the final platform, all fitting between a space about two feet wide, requires some contortion.\n\nAt the top of the crane is Mike, the oil man, whose job is to lubricate the equipment up top — different metal pieces of machinery that are all required to be in smooth working order to keep crane loads safe. Mike is apprenticing to be a crane operator.\n\nThe crane bed is essentially a glass pod with a single black chair and two blue arm rests, from which extend two levers, which look like joysticks. In the chair sits Charlie LaLond, the bearded crane operator, who wears a Red Sox hat and a blue Under Armour sweatshirt. He apprenticed for four years before he was approved to sit in the bed of the crane, he said. But sitting in classrooms every Tuesday and Thursday evening was nothing compared to the real-life experience he got on the job.\n\nThe two levers control different pieces of the crane’s operation — the hook’s swing left to right and the angle at which the 164-foot arm of the crane (called the “jib,” or the “boom”) extends from the turntable — while others control functions like windshield wipers and a heater. Immediately behind him is a daily checklist for oil-man Mike to work through before the crane can be operational.\n\nA normal day can have between four and five dozen lifts, LaLond says. On the EchelonSeaport site, the heaviest lift he’s had so far is 23,000 pounds, or 11.5 tons.\n\nThe coolest part of the job, LaLond says, is working with fellow crane operator “Big City” Joe, with whom he apprenticed for two years.\n\nThe days can be stressful, and LaLond never knows what exactly the day will bring. But, he said, there’s something beautiful about seeing the world the way no one else has quite gotten to see it yet.\n\n“You get beautiful days, sunrises, sunsets. You get your good and your bad,” LaLond says. “Where else can you have a view that people will pay millions of dollars for?”",

                'title' => 'New York is Exporting Its Most Eye Catching Product: Luxury Apartment Towers',
                'description' => "The Manhattan skyline is one of the world’s most iconic, but it wouldn’t be complete without the city’s famed residential supertalls. Luxury buildings like 432 Park Ave and One57 have set a high bar in the era of tower living, but the past decade has seen the vertical lifestyle catching on across the globe—from Boston to Monaco to New Orleans.\n\nTEL AVIV, ISRAEL\n\nYigal Zemah, CEO of developer Berggruen Residential, notes that with its booming economy, vibrant tech sector, and stable GDP, Tel Aviv is not a surprising site for high-end living. “Demand for high-quality products, such as high-end residential, became more relevant for the market in the last ten years,” he says over the phone, “I believe the trend will continue in the near future. It’s a trend that will never stop.”\n\n“We wanted to have something beautiful, timeless, transparent, and white,” Zemah says of the company’s latest project, a 42-story ode to minimalism designed by Richard Meier, who was chosen over famed architects like Norman Foster and Frank Gehry. The Meier on Rothschildis Israel’s second-tallest, and recently set a sales record after selling roughly $400 million dollars worth of apartments. (If you’re interested, they still have one penthouse available, although experts are uncertain how Meier’s recent accusations of sexual harassment (paywall) may affect final sales and resales at the apartment tower).\n\nBOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS\n\nNew England may not strike you as the bastion of luxury living, but the high-end market is seeing a “historic development boom,” writes Alex Shing—chairman and CEO of developer Cottonwood Management. An influx of industry giants like Amazon and GE has upped the demand for luxury condos, filled by the likes of Boston’s Millennium Tower, which has the look (and price tag) of an NYC sky manse. There’s also the 61-story One Dalton Street, New England’s tallest residential building—where one swanky penthouse is rumored to have fetched $40 million, a Boston record.\n\nThe city’s latest project is a 21-story marvel that Shing describes as “not only be a place to live, but a way of life.” Unlike NYC, Boston allows for some sprawl, so EchelonSeaport surrounds a 19,000 square-foot piazza likened to a European public square.\n\nDesigner Jeffrey Beers, who boasts a serious NYC footprint, says that Boston’s attraction lays in its connection to “the era of our founding forefathers; [Boston] is elegant, respectful, thoughtful and very tasteful.”\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA\n\nHigh-rise living took some time to catch on in the earthquake-prone city, but now that it has (earthquake-proof) luxury high-rises are cropping up all over the place.\n\nDesigned by the company behind parts of both Apple and Google’s campuses, the 70-story 181 Fremont Street is the tallest residential building in San Francisco, and the most earthquake-resistant west of the Mississippi thanks to an “exoskeleton” of caissons drilled into the earth’s bedrock. Prices range from $3.24 million to $42 million for a massive penthouse.\n\nMONACO\n\nMonaco is roughly 2 square kilometers in size, which is great for sea views, but tricky when 90 square feet goes for about $1 million. That said, the principality continues to attract tax exiles due to its status as a tax haven where residents aren’t required to pay income tax. Edward de Mallet Morgan, a partner at Knight Frank, says that the city-state’s luxury buildings are similar to New York’s when it comes to amenities and infrastructure. But while Monaco has some projects in the pipeline, scant new build property means that the waiting list for ownership is several years long—and the price tags are high.\n\nTour Odéon is the tallest building in the city-state, and also home to the world’s most expensive apartment, a $335 million penthouse that takes up the top five floors of the Alexandre Giraldi-designed tower.\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA\n\nWhile they often flock to the hills, LA’s rich and famous are often eyeing high-rises as post-recession sales begin to pick back up. More vertical living projects are being proposed, including a 70-story tower straight out of midtown Manhattan.\n\nMeanwhile, the city’s latest project is nearing completion: the new Century Plaza Towers will soon be finished, with two twin 46-story residential buildings flanking the redesigned Century Plaza hotel in Century City. Designed by Pei Cobb Freed, the towers will mirror Minoru Yamasaki’s iconic triangular Century Plaza Towers. The project’s total cost is rumored to be some $2.5 billion and the new hotel will be run by Fairmont.\n\nNEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA\n\nA “movement of affluent buyers in the form of millennials, young families, empty nesters, and business owners” is fueling a real estate boom in NOLA, writes Matt Schwartz, principal of Domain Companies and the developer behind NOLA’s first luxury residential project, The Standard. Post-Katrina, the city has seen an influx of buyers seeking to take advantage of NOLA’s rich cultural scene, while living in the type of high-end environment typically reserved for coastal cities.\n\nDesigned by Morris Adjmi, whose NYC portfolio includes 30 E 31st Street, The Standard features nearly 30,000 square feet of amenity space, a footprint that is practically unheard of in other luxury markets. In a nod to NOLA’s creative roots, the building’s lobby will double as an art gallery. Condos are priced from $575,000 for a one-bedroom to $1.41 million for a three-bedroom unit.",
